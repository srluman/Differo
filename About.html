            <p>Hi, my name is Scot, and I am the founder of Differō.com. A few years ago I found myself in a place where I was
              <strong>questioning a lot of what I believed.</strong> I had a few experiences that began to challenge what I had
              so confidently sworn to be true and <strong>I need some people to talk to </strong>that were unbiased and could remain obective. <br><br>
              As I looked around me, I began to realize I was surrounded by other people just like me and that those I felt most comforttable with
              would be too emotionally involved to remain objective. Thanks to <a href="http:\\Twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a> I got to know Martin Early who is the lead vocalist
              for <a href="http://www.ballroomthieves.com" target="_blank"><em>The Ballroom Theives</em></a>. Martin, and Atheist, and I, an Evangelical Christian, began emailing back anf forth talking about
              numerous difficult topics which choosing to mutually respect one another and keep an open mind. <br><br> I realized then that this was
              a huge need in the world. A place where people could learn from one another without the fear of being attacked.
              I needed a place where I could interact with people who were different than me but could maintain mutual respect instead of
              just seeking to argue. So I made one, and I call it "Differō"</p>
